## Abstract

> LiDARs provide accurate geometric measurements, making them valuable for ego-motion estimation and reconstruction tasks. However, managing an accurate and lightweight environment representation remains challenging. This work pioneers the use of Gaussian primitives for a LiDAR odometry and mapping pipeline, using spherical projection to refine scene representation from LiDAR data. The approach achieves state-of-the-art mapping performance with minimal GPU requirements, while matching current standards in registration accuracy. Efficiency and effectiveness make it a promising step toward real-time SLAM solutions.
